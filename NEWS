** June 2018

GNU Foliot version 0.9.8 is released.  This is a maintenance release,
which brings GNU Foliot up-to-date with Grip 0.2.0, upon which it
depends.  But other then that, there is no user visible change with this
release.

** Changes since 0.9.7

Here is a summary of the changes since version 0.9.7. See GNU Foliot's
[[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/foliot.git][git summary]] and [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/foliot.git/log/][git log]] for a complete description.

*** Dependencies

Grip 	      >= 0.2.0
Grip-Gnome
Grip-SQLite

Iwona

 This is the font used to make the GNU Foliot reports. It is now a hard
 depdency.  It was a soft dependency, but that was a mistake, since as
 it is, the making of the reports would fail unless the Iwona font is
 available.

Guile-Lib   >= 0.2.5

  This is a soft dependency: Guile-Lib is required to run the
  test-suite, which is recommended but not mandatory.

** March 2018

GNU Foliot version 0.9.7 is released.  This is a maintenance release,
which brings GNU Foliot up-to-date with Guile-2.2, which introduced an
incompatible module - goops related - change.

** Changes since 0.9.6-beta

Here is a summary of the changes since version 0.9.6-alpha. See GNU
Foliot's git summary [1] and git log [2] for a complete description:

	[1] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/foliot.git
	[2] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/foliot.git/log/

Dependencies
------------

	- Guile       >= 2.0.14
	- Guile-Gnome >= 2.16.5
	- Grip 	      >= 0.1.2
      Grip-Gnome
	  Grip-SQLite

Core
----

	- Guile-2.2 does not query (default-duplicate-binding-handler)
      at module expand eval load time as it did for Guile-2.0, a bad
      decision imo, but we have to cope with it, and declare
      #:duplicates (merge-generics ...) in each individual module
      instead.  We also removed our patched version of guild, since it
      became useless, and now use the version that comes with Guile.

	- All getters, setters, accessors and methods are now exported
      using g-export - defined in (grip g-export) - which re-export
      defined names (and precisely should only be used for getters,
      setters, accessors and methods).


** April the 14th, 2016
